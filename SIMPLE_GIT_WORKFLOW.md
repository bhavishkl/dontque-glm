# Simple Git Workflow - Main Branch Only

## The Only Command You Need

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Your commit message here" && git push origin main
```

## That's It!

This single command does everything:
1. **Stages all changes** (`git add .`)
2. **Commits with your message** (`git commit -m "..."`)
3. **Pushes to GitHub** (`git push origin main`)

## Current Status

✅ **Repository simplified:**
- Only `main` branch exists (local and remote)
- No more `master` branch confusion
- Clean, straightforward workflow

✅ **Latest commit:** `69c867b` - Successful test of git workflow with origin main branch

## Example Usage

```bash
# After making your code changes, just run:
git add . && git commit -m "Update dashboard UI components" && git push origin main

# Or using the script (if executable):
bash git-simple.sh
```

## No More Issues!

- ✅ No branch confusion
- ✅ No merge conflicts (unless working with others)
- ✅ Simple, one-command workflow
- ✅ Always pushes to main branch

This is exactly how VS Code works - one click to commit, one click to sync!
